# Project: Multi-class Image Classification with Neural Networks

This project focuses on building a neural network model for multi-class classification of grayscale images. The images are 32x32 pixels in size and originate from a dataset derived from Fashion MNIST.

## Objective

The goal is to train a neural network using PyTorch to classify input images into multiple categories based on the pixel values provided in CSV format (`train.csv` and `evaluate.csv`).

## Features

- Data loading and preprocessing using pandas and NumPy.
- Visualization of sample images.
- Model implementation using PyTorch (`nn.Module`).
- Training and evaluation pipeline with performance metrics.
- Accuracy scoring and confusion matrix visualization.
